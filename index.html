          <p>Over my Thanksgiving break my family and I decided to take a trip to Las Vegas. After 5 hours of waiting our flight took off at 3pm the day before Thanksgiving.
           Once we arrived we took a drive down the strip to look at everything. Around 5pm we checked into our hotel The Luxor. The Luxor Hotel was beautiful and crowded. 
           It was almost 4pm when we decided to check in and the line was very long. It took almost an hour to get checked in and about fifteen minutes to find our room. 
           At first, we got lost several times because we didn’t realize that the elevators were going sideways and we’d think we went straight up or down. 
           We thought we were at the same spot just tweleve floors up, but instead we were twelve floors up and over. There was still a lot of construction going on, but it wasn’t noisy at all. 
           I still walked around and saw the sights inside and outside of the hotel. Once the remodeling is done that place will be gorgeous. There is actually four connecting pools and a hot tub for guests and even a private pool and hot tub for “paying guests” We stayed in the pyramid room and I can’t remember how many times we bumped our heads on the window trying to look out or down. 
           The room was cozy. All the furniture was Egyptian-themed. The bathroom was huge and the shower (no bathtub) was pretty. At night, we never lost our hotel because we always went by the stream of light going up in the sky.

          <p>Over the course of several days my family and I went ziplining, went on the big feris wheel and ate at more places then I could name. 
            But the best part for me was being able to drive a lamborghini through a company called Exoctics Racing. Driving a lamboghini was an experince
            that I'll never forget. Overall my trip to Las Vegas was very fun and I can't wait to go back someday.
